## Evaluation Replication

To replicate this evaluation, you can download a [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/mhypony/sol-fuzzer-benchmark/general) and create a container from it.

Inside this container, `AFLs` folder is all you need to execute AFL-compiler-fuzzer, solfuzzer, and Fuzzol.

So please first enter it: `cd AFLs`

afl-compiler-fuzzer supports the use of comby-decomposer to splice up collected code templates and fragments. To obtain these fragment, please first

```
cd comby-decomposer
```

, and then use tmux to launch the server

```
tmux new -s server
export NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=8192"
node server.js --generate 1.0
```

, and close the tmux terminal with `ctrl + B + D`.

Then, go into afl-compiler-fuzzer folder by `cd afl-compiler-fuzzer` and `sudo make install`.

Finally, go back to `~/AFLs`, and run

```
afl-fuzz-compiler -2 25 -1 75 -m 10240 -i acf-seeds -o findings/ solidity/build-acf/solc/solc @@
```

To run solfuzzer,

First drop by afl folder `cd afl` and `sudo make install`, then

```
afl-fuzz -m 10240 -t 2000 -i solfuzzer-seeds -o findings solidity/build-solfuzzer/test/tools/solfuzzer
```

To run Fuzzol, conduct these commands in `~/AFLs`

```
cd Fuzzol
sudo make install
cd ..
afl-fuzz -m 10240 -i fuzzol-seeds -o findings solidity/build-fuzzol/solc/solc @@
```

For all these three execution, the experimental results are all located in `~/AFLs/findings`, your can change `findings` to other names in the above execution commands.

After collecting mutated test cases inside findings/queue, you can analyze if these test cases can trigger bugs in this benchmark via executing `check.py` (after some modification).

## Experimental Results

Folders `AFL-compiler-fuzzer`, `solfuzzer`, and `Fuzzol` contain their fuzzing results separately in 20-day execution.

Bug-triggered test cases for crashes found by `AFL-compiler-fuzzer` on the latest version of Solidity compiler are stored in `AFL-compiler-fuzzer/crashes`.
After [discussing](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/14719#issuecomment-1842628879) with a developer of Solidity compiler, it's confirmed that these ten crashes are the same bug.

The two folders all include `fuzzer_stats` and `plot_data`.
`fuzzer_stats` contains the fuzzing summary and `plot_data` is the chronological record of the fuzzing process.
